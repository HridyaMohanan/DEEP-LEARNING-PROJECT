# 🤖 Deep Learning Project - Image Classification

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model using *TensorFlow* and *Keras* for image classification.

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a deep learning model that can classify images into predefined categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (built-in in Keras)
- 10 Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
- 60,000 32x32 color images in total:
  - 50,000 for training
  - 10,000 for testing

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)
- MaxPooling Layers
- Flatten
- Dense Layers with ReLU
- Final Softmax Output Layer
